The final Project (Artwork Application) for PH360 blockchain class. Jing Jiang &amp; Zheng Liu

The source code of the application and demo website can be found in the truffle-source folder.

The proposal slides and documentation and the final slides and documentation can be fould in the root directory.

This is Jing and Alex's project to build a simple Ethereum decentralized application implementing a artwork trading platform.
We used Truffle, Metamask, and Ganache to build our application.
We used Solidity to write the smart contracts.
We used lite-server to host our demo website locally, and we used bootstrap to style our demo website.

The functions of the demo website is still incomplete, it can only serves as a demonstration of the process of trading an art. However, all functions works fine on the Solidity IDE. We are still looking for better approaches to solve the ID management problem.
